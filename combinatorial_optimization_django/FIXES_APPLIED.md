## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependencies File
**Problem**: `requirements.txt` was empty
**Solution**: Created complete requirements.txt with necessary packages:
```
Django>=4.0,<6.0
psutil>=5.9.0
```

### 2. Unnecessary Files Removed
**Problem**: Project contained cache files and empty directories
**Files Removed**:
- Empty `optimizer/static/css/` folder
- All `__pycache__/` directories (6 locations cleaned)

### 3. UI Status
**Original UI Preserved**: No changes made to the user interface
- All CSS styling remains exactly as it was
- All HTML templates unchanged
- Bootstrap 5 design maintained
